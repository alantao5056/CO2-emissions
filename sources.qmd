Here are the links to the Data-Sets I used:

There was a lot of Carbon emissions data based on region and countries grouped by socioeconomic status which I removed from the data to make it more simple. I did this by using the 'filter()' command and filtering out any value in which the country code did not represent a valid country. This meant that any "country" which was filtered out had to be some sort of different type of grouping that did not represent what I was trying to convey in the heatmap.

I also had to select certain variables from the industrialization data set by using the 'select' command. There were too many other variables to use the filter command, so I just used select instead.

<!-- The data for this graph was sourced from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA). After that, the data was visualized into a heatmap which shows emissions by country based on the color that is filled in. -->
